### Why?
- Encourage open source initiatves taken both by Egyptian companies and independent Egyptian engineers.
- Help young developers, looking to contribute to their first open source project, find approachable projects, and easy access to mentorship and guidance in their own native language.
- An actual opensource list for listing opensource projects! Because the internet is full of old and obsolete news sites, magazines and google docs.
