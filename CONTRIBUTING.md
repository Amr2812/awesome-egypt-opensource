# Contribution Guide

## How to contribute

- Simply submit a Pull-request and add your project to end of any list in the README.md
- OR open an issue asking to add your favorite project.
- TOC is auto generated, so just add the project link and description under the correct category title
- If you can't find a category, add it
- Always add your link to the end of the list. the list is sorted by the order projects are added, not by stars or alphabetically.

## Criteria for accepting a new submitted project

Projects submitted must be active and useful, these are a sensible list of minimum requirements:
- Must be active, *Last commit (less than 1 year) ago*
- Must contain a comprehensive README.md

- Must be an original not a fork.
- A Fork is accepted only if is is hard fork, with its own unique name, stars, issues and community and features.
- Not a Portfolio, Course Work, Learning Experiment, Interview Task.

## Dead projects and Maintaining the list

Depending on the volume of projects submitted, we might go through the list every month and remove any dead, unmaintained or obsolete project.
If the list gets too long, we might start asking for the community votes on pull-requests to accept them.
