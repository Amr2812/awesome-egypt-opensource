# Contribution Guide

## How to contribute

- Simply submit a Pull-request and add your project to end of any list in the README.md
- OR open an issue asking to add your favorite project.
- TOC is auto generated, so just add the project link and description under the correct category title
- If you can't find a category, add it
- Always add your link to the end of the list. the list is sorted by the order projects are added, not by stars or alphabetically.

## Criteria for accepting a new submitted project

Projects sumbitted must be active and useful, these are a sinsible list of minimum requirements:
- Must be active, *Last commit (less than 1 year) ago*
- Must contain a comprehesive README.md
- Must contain an opensource liscense (not essentially OSI approved, but not copyright).
- Must be an original not a fork.
- A Fork is accepted only if is is hard fork, with its own unique name, stars, issues and community and features.

## Dead projects and Maintaining the list

If the list gets too long, we might start asking for the community votes on pull-requests to accept them.
